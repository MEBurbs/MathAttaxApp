# MathAttaxApp

This app was created through the Oak Acadamey Full Android 11 MasterClass.
The idea and some code came from the class, but the design and majority of the code was written by me.

This application is an example of layering multiple layouts together, UI timers, buttons, changing TextViews, and some "fun"
design choices if I say so myself. 

This is intended to be an example of the work I can do.
